This repository contains the T3 Vault Memorization Assistant module, designed for critical memorization tasks using principles from Anki and SuperMemo. This module focuses on two distinct types of memorization:

Memorizing 6 critical words in a specific order.
Recognizing 16 critical images/shapes/sounds or fractals in a specific order.

These elements serve as sequential keys to unlock a secure vault, first partially with words and then fully with images. The module should employ robust encryption to handle sensitive data and ensure that these critical items are never forgotten.

Scoring and Retesting Logic:

Principles from Anki and SuperMemo:
Spaced Repetition: Adapt intervals based on recall success. For critical items, shorter and more frequent intervals ensure higher retention.
Active Recall: Prompting users to actively recall information rather than passively reviewing.
Immediate Feedback: Correcting mistakes immediately to reinforce learning.
Adaptation for Critical Memorization:
Zero-Error Tolerance: Ensure that items must be recalled perfectly in order.
Review Sessions: Review sessions to simulate real-world scenarios.

Research Basis:

SuperMemoâ€™s Algorithm (SM2): Adjusts intervals based on ease of recall, with conservative intervals for critical data.
Cognitive Load Theory: Regular spaced reviews reduce cognitive load and enhance long-term memory (Sweller, 1988).
